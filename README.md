# Wiki Translation Tool

This is a proposal of a text editor designed for wiki translators. Intended features are:

- Automatically get wikitext from wiki servers and upload translated text back to it.
- Highlight wiki syntaxes
- Auto completion or repalcement and quick access for templates and internal links and grammar
- Glossary
- Preview pages (might need internet)
- Link to habitica
- Progress overview
- Show wiki activities and track changes in source pages

As far as I know, there has not been any text editor that specifies in wiki translation. I hope it will simplify wiki translation by relieving translators from endless grammar details and CN/EN switching and so on.
