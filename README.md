# wiki-translation-tool

This is a proposal of a text editor designed for wiki translators. Intended features are:

- automatically get wikitext from wiki servers and upload translated text back to it.
- highlight wiki syntaxes
- auto completion or repalcement and quick access for templates and internal links and grammar
- glossary
- preview pages (might need internet)
- link to habitica
- progress overview
- show wiki activities

As far as I know there has not been any text editor that specifies in wiki translation. I hope it will simplify wiki translation by relieving translators from endless grammar details and cn/en switching and so on.
